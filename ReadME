Fastai setup:

As we are working with the outdated version fastai 0.7.0. due to functionality issues, there are a few steps that need to be executed before starting with the code.

A detailled overview is provided by Jeremy Howard in the fastai forum (https://forums.fast.ai/t/fastai-v0-7-install-issues-thread/24652)

On Mac:
1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to desired folder:            cd "~\path\folder"
3. Clone fastai repository from GitHub:   git clone https://github.com/fastai/fastai.git
4. Navigate to cloned repository:         cd fastai
5. Create environment:                    conda env create -f environment-cpu.yml
6. Activate environment:                  conda activate fastai-cpu
7. Start Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook

Make sure you activate the environment every time before starting the jupyter notebook


On Windows the commands have to be run in the Anaconda Prompt console. The Prompt console must be runned as an administrator.
